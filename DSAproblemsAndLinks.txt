1. Hexadecimal numbers(from hackerearth)
	We can simply check all numbers in the range [L,R] converting them into hexadecimal and then computing the GCD of that number and the its sum of digits.
	Converting a number into hexadecimal take O(LogN) time.
	Computing the GCD takes amortised O(LogN) time.
	Therefore total time complexity will be : O(N * LogN * LogN).
